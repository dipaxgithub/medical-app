      "Regurgitation",
      "Dysphagia",
      "Abdominal pain"
    ],
    "correct": "Regurgitation",
    "explanation": "Regurgitation is the most common presenting symptom of GERD in infants, with approximately 70-85% of infants exhibiting regurgitation during the first 2 months of life. This physiologic reflux typically resolves by 12-14 months of age in most infants and is a normal developmental phenomenon.",

      "Endoscopy with biopsy",
      "Impedance monitoring",
      "Combined multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH monitoring (MII-pH)"
    ],
    "correct": "Combined multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH monitoring (MII-pH)",
    "explanation": "Combined multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH monitoring (MII-pH) is considered the gold standard for GERD diagnosis in children as it can detect both acid and non-acid reflux events, as well as their relationship to symptoms. This is particularly important in children who may have significant non-acid reflux that would be missed by pH monitoring alone.",

      "Recurrent pneumonia",
      "Chronic sinusitis",
      "Asthma",
      "Otitis media"
    ],
    "correct": "Asthma",
    "explanation": "Asthma is the most common extraesophageal manifestation of GERD in children. There is a bidirectional relationship between GERD and asthma: GERD can exacerbate asthma symptoms through microaspiration and vagally mediated reflexes, while asthma medications and increased negative intrathoracic pressure during asthma episodes can worsen GERD. Approximately 50-80% of children with asthma have concomitant GERD.",

    ],
    "correct": "Proton pump inhibitors",
    "explanation": "Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are not recommended as first-line therapy for GERD in infants. Multiple randomized controlled trials have failed to demonstrate efficacy of PPIs for treating symptoms attributed to GERD in infants, and they carry risks of adverse effects including increased respiratory and GI infections, nutrient malabsorption, and alteration of the gut microbiome. Conservative approaches (feeding modifications, positioning) should be tried first.",

      "Elimination diet for mother (for breastfed infants)",
      "Prokinetic agents"
    ],
    "correct": "Thickened feeds and positioning therapy",
    "explanation": "For uncomplicated GERD in infants, the recommended initial management consists of conservative approaches including thickened feeds and positioning therapy (elevating the head of the bed, avoiding prolonged supine positioning particularly after feeds). These interventions have been shown to reduce the frequency and volume of regurgitation without pharmacologic side effects.",

    ],
    "correct": "Barrett's esophagus",
    "explanation": "Barrett's esophagus is characterized by the replacement of normal esophageal squamous epithelium with specialized intestinal columnar epithelium (intestinal metaplasia) as a result of chronic GERD. While relatively rare in children compared to adults, it is a significant concern as it is a precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma. Barrett's esophagus is diagnosed by endoscopy with biopsy showing intestinal metaplasia.",

    ],
    "correct": "Exposure to cow's milk protein",
    "explanation": "Cow's milk protein exposure is most likely to exacerbate GERD symptoms in this scenario. Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) and GERD frequently coexist in infants and young children, with up to 40-56% of infants with GERD having CMPA. The clinical manifestations of CMPA can mimic or worsen GERD symptoms, including regurgitation, irritability, and Sandifer-like posturing (arching of the back). A 2-4 week trial of extensively hydrolyzed or amino acid-based formula (or maternal elimination diet for breastfed infants) is often recommended for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.",

      "Epilepsy",
      "Down syndrome"
    ],
    "correct": "Cerebral palsy",
    "explanation": "Cerebral palsy is the neurological condition most commonly associated with severe GERD in children. The prevalence of GERD in children with cerebral palsy ranges from 50-75%. Contributing factors include impaired esophageal motility, delayed gastric emptying, seizure medications that may affect lower esophageal sphincter pressure, scoliosis, prolonged supine positioning, and increased intra-abdominal pressure due to spasticity. These children often require more aggressive management including consideration of surgical intervention (fundoplication).",

    ],
    "correct": "Failure to respond to medical therapy",
    "explanation": "Failure to respond to optimal medical therapy is the most common indication for anti-reflux surgery (fundoplication) in pediatric patients with GERD. Other indications include life-threatening events (such as recurrent aspiration pneumonia or apparent life-threatening events), dependence on long-term medical therapy with significant side effects, and complications of GERD such as severe esophagitis, stricture, or Barrett's esophagus. The decision for surgical management should be made carefully after thorough diagnostic evaluation and consideration of risks and benefits.",

    "question": "Which of the following dietary recommendations would be LEAST appropriate for an 8-year-old with symptomatic GERD?",
    "options": [
      "Avoiding caffeine",
      "Avoiding chocolate",
      "Limiting fatty foods",
      "Strict elimination of all acidic foods",
      "Smaller, more frequent meals"
    ],
    "correct": "Strict elimination of all acidic foods",
    "explanation": "Strict elimination of all acidic foods would be the least appropriate dietary recommendation for an 8-year-old with symptomatic GERD. While some acidic foods may exacerbate symptoms in certain patients, a blanket elimination of all acidic foods is overly restrictive, unnecessary, and could lead to nutritional deficiencies in growing children. Current pediatric GERD management guidelines recommend individualized dietary modifications based on symptom triggers rather than extensive dietary restrictions. Foods that commonly trigger symptoms include caffeine, chocolate, spicy foods, and high-fat meals, but elimination should be targeted to the specific triggers identified for each patient.",

      "Failure of the nephric duct migration"
    ],
    "correct": "Incomplete separation of the foregut",
    "explanation": "Tracheoesophageal malformations result from incomplete separation of the primitive foregut into the ventral respiratory (tracheal) and dorsal digestive (esophageal) components during the 4th to 6th weeks of embryonic development. This defect in tracheoesophageal septation leads to various types of fistulae and/or esophageal atresia.",

      "Regurgitation, cyanosis, and abdominal distention"
    ],
    "correct": "Excessive salivation, choking with feeds, and abdominal distention",
    "explanation": "The classic triad includes excessive salivation (pooling in the blind esophageal pouch), choking/coughing episodes with attempted feeding, and abdominal distention (due to air entering the stomach via the distal TEF). This clinical presentation is highly suggestive of EA with distal TEF (Type C).",

    ],
    "correct": "VACTERL association",
    "explanation": "Approximately 30-50% of patients with tracheoesophageal fistula have associated anomalies, with VACTERL association being the most common. VACTERL represents a non-random association of defects including Vertebral anomalies, Anal atresia, Cardiac defects, Tracheo-Esophageal fistula, Renal anomalies, and Limb defects. The presence of any three of these anomalies suggests VACTERL association.",

      "Barium swallow",
      "CT scan of chest",
      "MRI of chest"
    ],
    "correct": "Chest X-ray with nasogastric tube placement",
    "explanation": "A chest X-ray with an attempted nasogastric tube placement is the most definitive initial imaging study for diagnosing esophageal atresia. The tube will coil or stop in the blind upper esophageal pouch rather than continuing into the stomach. This finding, along with the presence or absence of gas in the gastrointestinal tract, helps determine the type of tracheoesophageal malformation.",

    ],
    "correct": "Primary repair via thoracotomy",
    "explanation": "Primary repair via thoracotomy is the preferred approach for stable neonates with Type C TEF. This involves division and closure of the fistula and primary anastomosis of the esophageal segments. This approach has shown excellent outcomes in stable infants without significant cardiac or respiratory compromise, with survival rates exceeding 95% in most centers.",

    ],
    "correct": "Polyhydramnios with a small or absent stomach bubble",
    "explanation": "The combination of polyhydramnios with a small or absent stomach bubble on prenatal ultrasound has the highest predictive value for esophageal atresia. Polyhydramnios results from the fetus's inability to swallow and absorb amniotic fluid due to the esophageal obstruction. However, this finding has limited sensitivity (only about 50% of cases), especially in cases with a distal TEF where some fluid can still reach the stomach.",

    ],
    "correct": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)",
    "explanation": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects approximately 40-65% of patients with repaired esophageal atresia throughout their lives. This high prevalence is due to several factors including intrinsic esophageal dysmotility, shortened esophageal length, and disruption of the angle of His. Chronic GERD can lead to Barrett's esophagus and increases the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma in this population, necessitating long-term surveillance.",
