    "question": "Which of the following best describes the pathophysiology of meconium aspiration syndrome?",
    "options": [
      "Simple mechanical obstruction of airways",
      "Chemical pneumonitis with airway obstruction and surfactant inactivation",
      "Purely inflammatory response to foreign material",
      "Direct toxic effect on type II pneumocytes",
      "Bacterial superinfection of meconium-filled alveoli"
    ],
    "correct": "Chemical pneumonitis with airway obstruction and surfactant inactivation",
    "explanation": "Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) involves a complex pathophysiology where meconium causes mechanical obstruction of airways, chemical pneumonitis due to inflammatory mediators, and inactivation of surfactant. This leads to ventilation-perfusion mismatch, atelectasis, and potential persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN).",

    "question": "Which risk factor is most strongly associated with meconium-stained amniotic fluid?",
    "options": [
      "Maternal diabetes",
      "Preterm delivery",
      "Post-term pregnancy",
      "Maternal hypertension",
      "Multiple gestation"
    ],
    "correct": "Post-term pregnancy",
    "explanation": "Post-term pregnancy (>42 weeks gestation) is the strongest risk factor for meconium-stained amniotic fluid. The incidence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid increases from approximately 10% at term to 40-50% in post-term pregnancies, likely due to increased gut maturity and relative placental insufficiency causing fetal stress.",

    "question": "What is the current recommendation regarding routine intrapartum suctioning of the oropharynx and nasopharynx at the perineum in infants born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid?",
    "options": [
      "Recommended for all infants born through meconium-stained fluid",
      "Recommended only for thick meconium",
      "Recommended only for non-vigorous infants",
      "No longer recommended",
      "Recommended only for infants <37 weeks gestation"
    ],
    "correct": "No longer recommended",
    "explanation": "Since 2015, routine intrapartum suctioning of the oropharynx and nasopharynx at the perineum in infants born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid is no longer recommended. Randomized controlled trials have shown no benefit to this practice in preventing meconium aspiration syndrome, and current resuscitation guidelines focus on immediate assessment and resuscitation as needed.",

  {
    "question": "Which radiographic finding is MOST consistent with meconium aspiration syndrome?",
    "options": [
      "Ground glass opacification",
      "Pneumothorax",
      "Lobar consolidation",
      "Hyperinflation with patchy opacities",
      "Pleural effusion"
    ],
    "correct": "Hyperinflation with patchy opacities",
    "explanation": "Chest radiographs in meconium aspiration syndrome typically show hyperinflation with patchy opacities (coarse, irregular infiltrates) due to areas of obstruction and atelectasis adjacent to areas of air trapping. This creates the characteristic appearance of hyperexpansion with 'fluffy' or patchy infiltrates distributed throughout the lung fields.",

  {
    "question": "What is the most appropriate initial respiratory support for a term infant with moderate meconium aspiration syndrome and increasing oxygen requirements?",
    "options": [
      "Low-flow nasal cannula",
      "Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)",
      "Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV)",
      "High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)",
      "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)"
    ],
    "correct": "Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)",
    "explanation": "For a term infant with moderate meconium aspiration syndrome and increasing oxygen requirements, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is typically the most appropriate initial respiratory support. CPAP helps maintain alveolar recruitment, improves oxygenation, and may prevent the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. More invasive ventilation strategies would be reserved for worsening respiratory status or failure of CPAP.",

    "question": "Which complication is most closely associated with severe meconium aspiration syndrome?",
    "options": [
      "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia",

      "Pulmonary interstitial emphysema",
      "Vocal cord paralysis",
      "Pulmonary hemorrhage"
    ],
    "correct": "Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)",
    "explanation": "Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is the most closely associated complication with severe meconium aspiration syndrome, occurring in 15-20% of MAS cases. Meconium causes pulmonary vasoconstriction through several mechanisms, including hypoxia, acidosis, and inflammatory mediators. This leads to right-to-left shunting through the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus, worsening the hypoxemia and creating a vicious cycle.",

    "question": "Which therapeutic approach has shown the most consistent benefit in randomized controlled trials for the treatment of meconium aspiration syndrome?",

      "Surfactant replacement therapy",
      "Bronchodilators",
      "Therapeutic lung lavage"
    ],
    "correct": "Surfactant replacement therapy",
    "explanation": "Surfactant replacement therapy has shown the most consistent benefit in randomized controlled trials for the treatment of meconium aspiration syndrome. Exogenous surfactant helps replace the inactivated endogenous surfactant and improves lung compliance and oxygenation. Meta-analyses have demonstrated that surfactant therapy reduces the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and improves clinical outcomes in infants with MAS.",

    "correct": "5-10%",
    "explanation": "The incidence of meconium aspiration syndrome among infants born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid in developed countries is approximately 5-10%. While meconium-stained amniotic fluid occurs in about 8-20% of all deliveries at term, only a fraction of these infants will develop MAS. The incidence has decreased over recent decades due to improved obstetric and neonatal care practices.",

    "question": "Which of the following interventions has been shown to decrease the incidence of meconium aspiration syndrome?",
    "options": [
      "Amnioinfusion during labor",

      "Prophylactic intubation of all infants born through meconium-stained fluid",
      "Elective cesarean section for all pregnancies with meconium-stained fluid",
      "Active management of labor to prevent post-term pregnancy"
    ],
    "correct": "Active management of labor to prevent post-term pregnancy",
    "explanation": "Active management of labor to prevent post-term pregnancy has been shown to decrease the incidence of meconium aspiration syndrome. The incidence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid and subsequent MAS increases significantly in post-term pregnancies. By preventing post-term pregnancies through active management (including induction of labor before 42 weeks), the risk of MAS is reduced. Other listed interventions have either shown no benefit or inconsistent results in high-quality studies.",

    "question": "What is the most important long-term respiratory outcome associated with severe meconium aspiration syndrome?",

      "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia",
      "Pulmonary fibrosis",
      "Chronic pulmonary hypertension"
    ],
    "correct": "Reactive airway disease/asthma",
    "explanation": "Reactive airway disease/asthma is the most important long-term respiratory outcome associated with severe meconium aspiration syndrome. Follow-up studies of infants with severe MAS have demonstrated an increased incidence of reactive airway disease, wheezing, and asthma during childhood and adolescence. This is thought to be related to the initial inflammatory damage to the airways and the subsequent airway hyperreactivity that develops in response to the initial insult.",
