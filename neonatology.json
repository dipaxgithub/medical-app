The incidence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid and subsequent MAS increases significantly in post-term pregnancies. By preventing post-term pregnancies through active management (including induction of labor before 42 weeks), the risk of MAS is reduced.

Follow-up studies of infants with severe MAS have demonstrated an increased incidence of reactive airway disease, wheezing, and asthma during childhood and adolescence. This is thought to be related to the initial inflammatory damage to the airways and the subsequent airway hyperreactivity that develops in response to the initial insult.",

Among pathological causes, ABO incompatibility (particularly type O mother with type A or B infant) is the most common cause of early hemolytic jaundice in the first 24 hours.

The values given (total bilirubin 12 mg/dL with direct fraction of 0.4 mg/dL at day 2) are consistent with physiological jaundice in a term infant.

    "explanation": "Free (unbound) indirect bilirubin is lipid-soluble and can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly when the bilirubin-binding capacity of albumin is exceeded or when substances that displace bilirubin from albumin are present. This unbound indirect bilirubin can then enter the brain and cause neurotoxicity, leading to kernicterus. Direct (conjugated) bilirubin is water-soluble and does not cross the blood-brain barrier, thus not causing kernicterus.",

    "explanation": "For a 3-day-old (72-hour) term infant with total serum bilirubin of 18 mg/dL, phototherapy is indicated according to the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. This level is above the phototherapy threshold but below the exchange transfusion threshold for a term infant at 72 hours. Observation alone would be inadequate, while exchange transfusion would be reserved for higher bilirubin levels or signs of bilirubin encephalopathy.

This is distinct from breastfeeding jaundice, which is related to inadequate milk intake. Breast milk jaundice is characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and is thought to be caused by factors in breast milk that inhibit bilirubin conjugation or enhance intestinal bilirubin absorption.

These may present as oral-buccal-lingual movements, ocular signs (sustained eye opening with ocular fixation or deviation), limb movements (pedaling, swimming), or autonomic phenomena.

Early-onset hypocalcemia is often associated with prematurity, maternal diabetes, perinatal asphyxia, and maternal hyperparathyroidism.

    "correct": "Underlying etiology",
    "explanation": "The underlying etiology of neonatal seizures is the strongest predictor of long-term neurodevelopmental outcome, much more so than seizure characteristics themselves. Certain etiologies such as severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, cerebral malformations, and some genetic disorders carry a particularly poor prognosis. While seizure characteristics like duration, timing of onset, treatment response, and status epilepticus may influence outcomes, they are less powerful predictors than the underlying cause. This underscores the importance of thorough diagnostic evaluation to identify the etiology of neonatal seizures.",

    "correct": "Myoclonic seizures",
    "explanation": "Myoclonic seizures in neonates are strongly associated with pyridoxine dependency, though other seizure types can also occur. Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy classically presents with refractory myoclonic or mixed seizures in the neonatal period that are resistant to conventional antiseizure medications but respond dramatically to pyridoxine administration. The condition is caused by mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene encoding antiquitin, resulting in accumulation of α-aminoadipic semialdehyde and inactivation of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, the active form of vitamin B6.",

    "correct": "Trial of pyridoxine",
    "explanation": "In a term neonate with drug-resistant seizures and normal neuroimaging, a therapeutic trial of pyridoxine should be performed to evaluate for pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy. This rare but treatable metabolic cause of neonatal seizures can be diagnosed by observing clinical and EEG response to intravenous pyridoxine administration. Untreated pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy leads to severe developmental consequences, making early diagnosis critical. The diagnostic evaluation should also include other vitamin-responsive epilepsies (e.g., pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, folinic acid, biotin), but pyridoxine trial is often the first step due to its safety, availability, and the devastating consequences of missed diagnosis.",
