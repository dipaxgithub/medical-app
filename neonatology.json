      "Simple mechanical obstruction of airways",

      "Purely inflammatory response to foreign material",

      "Bacterial superinfection of meconium-filled alveoli"
    ],
    "correct": "Chemical pneumonitis with airway obstruction and surfactant inactivation",
    "explanation": "Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) involves a complex pathophysiology where meconium causes mechanical obstruction of airways, chemical pneumonitis due to inflammatory mediators, and inactivation of surfactant. This leads to ventilation-perfusion mismatch, atelectasis, and potential persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN).",

      "Maternal hypertension",

    "correct": "Post-term pregnancy",
    "explanation": "Post-term pregnancy (>42 weeks gestation) is the strongest risk factor for meconium-stained amniotic fluid. The incidence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid increases from approximately 10% at term to 40-50% in post-term pregnancies, likely due to increased gut maturity and relative placental insufficiency causing fetal stress.",

    "explanation": "Since 2015, routine intrapartum suctioning of the oropharynx and nasopharynx at the perineum in infants born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid is no longer recommended. Randomized controlled trials have shown no benefit to this practice in preventing meconium aspiration syndrome, and current resuscitation guidelines focus on immediate assessment and resuscitation as needed.",

      "Hyperinflation with patchy opacities",

    "correct": "Hyperinflation with patchy opacities",
    "explanation": "Chest radiographs in meconium aspiration syndrome typically show hyperinflation with patchy opacities (coarse, irregular infiltrates) due to areas of obstruction and atelectasis adjacent to areas of air trapping. This creates the characteristic appearance of hyperexpansion with 'fluffy' or patchy infiltrates distributed throughout the lung fields.",

    "correct": "Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)",
    "explanation": "For a term infant with moderate meconium aspiration syndrome and increasing oxygen requirements, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is typically the most appropriate initial respiratory support. CPAP helps maintain alveolar recruitment, improves oxygenation, and may prevent the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. More invasive ventilation strategies would be reserved for worsening respiratory status or failure of CPAP.",

    "correct": "Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)",
    "explanation": "Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is the most closely associated complication with severe meconium aspiration syndrome, occurring in 15-20% of MAS cases. Meconium causes pulmonary vasoconstriction through several mechanisms, including hypoxia, acidosis, and inflammatory mediators. This leads to right-to-left shunting through the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus, worsening the hypoxemia and creating a vicious cycle.",

    "explanation": "Surfactant replacement therapy has shown the most consistent benefit in randomized controlled trials for the treatment of meconium aspiration syndrome. Exogenous surfactant helps replace the inactivated endogenous surfactant and improves lung compliance and oxygenation. Meta-analyses have demonstrated that surfactant therapy reduces the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and improves clinical outcomes in infants with MAS.",

    "correct": "Active management of labor to prevent post-term pregnancy",
    "explanation": "Active management of labor to prevent post-term pregnancy has been shown to decrease the incidence of meconium aspiration syndrome. The incidence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid and subsequent MAS increases significantly in post-term pregnancies. By preventing post-term pregnancies through active management (including induction of labor before 42 weeks), the risk of MAS is reduced. Other listed interventions have either shown no benefit or inconsistent results in high-quality studies.",

    "correct": "Reactive airway disease/asthma",
    "explanation": "Reactive airway disease/asthma is the most important long-term respiratory outcome associated with severe meconium aspiration syndrome. Follow-up studies of infants with severe MAS have demonstrated an increased incidence of reactive airway disease, wheezing, and asthma during childhood and adolescence. This is thought to be related to the initial inflammatory damage to the airways and the subsequent airway hyperreactivity that develops in response to the initial insult.",

    "explanation": "According to the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, phototherapy initiation thresholds are based on age in hours, gestational age, and risk factors.

    "correct": "ABO incompatibility",
    "explanation": "Jaundice appearing within the first 24 hours of life is always pathological. Among pathological causes, ABO incompatibility (particularly type O mother with type A or B infant) is the most common cause of early hemolytic jaundice in the first 24 hours. Physiological jaundice typically appears after 24 hours, breast milk jaundice after 3-5 days, while hypothyroidism and Crigler-Najjar syndrome are much rarer causes.",

    ],
    "correct": "Positive Coombs test",
    "explanation": "A positive direct Coombs test (direct antiglobulin test) indicates antibodies attached to red blood cells, which is highly suggestive of immune-mediated hemolysis as seen in blood group incompatibilities like ABO or Rh incompatibility. This finding, along with anemia, elevated reticulocyte count, and predominantly indirect hyperbilirubinemia, is characteristic of hemolytic disease of the newborn.",

    "correct": "Physiological jaundice",
    "explanation": "This scenario describes physiological jaundice, which is characterized by onset after 24 hours of life, predominantly indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia (direct fraction <20% of total), and mild-moderate elevation of bilirubin. The values given (total bilirubin 12 mg/dL with direct fraction of 0.4 mg/dL at day 2) are consistent with physiological jaundice in a term infant. Biliary atresia, neonatal hepatitis, galactosemia, and tyrosinemia would all present with significant direct hyperbilirubinemia.",

      "Indirect bilirubin unbound to albumin",
      "Delta bilirubin"
    ],
    "correct": "Indirect bilirubin unbound to albumin",
    "explanation": "Free (unbound) indirect bilirubin is lipid-soluble and can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly when the bilirubin-binding capacity of albumin is exceeded or when substances that displace bilirubin from albumin are present. This unbound indirect bilirubin can then enter the brain and cause neurotoxicity, leading to kernicterus. Direct (conjugated) bilirubin is water-soluble and does not cross the blood-brain barrier, thus not causing kernicterus.",

Males tend to have higher peak bilirubin levels than females, though the exact mechanism is not fully understood.",

    "explanation": "Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I is characterized by complete absence of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) enzyme activity, which is essential for conjugation of bilirubin. This results in severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia from birth that is refractory to phenobarbital treatment and often requires phototherapy, exchange transfusion, and eventually liver transplantation to prevent kernicterus.",

    "explanation": "For a 3-day-old (72-hour) term infant with total serum bilirubin of 18 mg/dL, phototherapy is indicated according to the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. This level is above the phototherapy threshold but below the exchange transfusion threshold for a term infant at 72 hours. Observation alone would be inadequate, while exchange transfusion would be reserved for higher bilirubin levels or signs of bilirubin encephalopathy. IVIG is indicated primarily for isoimmune hemolytic disease, and discontinuing breastfeeding is rarely necessary.",

    "explanation": "Breast milk jaundice typically presents after 3-5 days of life, peaks by 7-15 days, and may persist for 3-12 weeks with gradual resolution while continuing breastfeeding. This is distinct from breastfeeding jaundice, which is related to inadequate milk intake. Breast milk jaundice is characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and is thought to be caused by factors in breast milk that inhibit bilirubin conjugation or enhance intestinal bilirubin absorption. It rarely requires cessation of breastfeeding unless bilirubin levels approach the exchange transfusion threshold.",
