    "explanation": "Free (unbound) indirect bilirubin is lipid-soluble and can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly when the bilirubin-binding capacity of albumin is exceeded or when substances that displace bilirubin from albumin are present. This unbound indirect bilirubin can then enter the brain and cause neurotoxicity, leading to kernicterus.

    "explanation": "For a 3-day-old (72-hour) term infant with total serum bilirubin of 18 mg/dL, phototherapy is indicated according to the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. This level is above the phototherapy threshold but below the exchange transfusion threshold for a term infant at 72 hours. Observation alone would be inadequate, while exchange transfusion would be reserved for higher bilirubin levels or signs of bilirubin encephalopathy.

This is distinct from breastfeeding jaundice, which is related to inadequate milk intake. Breast milk jaundice is characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and is thought to be caused by factors in breast milk that inhibit bilirubin conjugation or enhance intestinal bilirubin absorption.

    "correct": "Underlying etiology",
    "explanation": "The underlying etiology of neonatal seizures is the strongest predictor of long-term neurodevelopmental outcome, much more so than seizure characteristics themselves. Certain etiologies such as severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, cerebral malformations, and some genetic disorders carry a particularly poor prognosis. While seizure characteristics like duration, timing of onset, treatment response, and status epilepticus may influence outcomes, they are less powerful predictors than the underlying cause. This underscores the importance of thorough diagnostic evaluation to identify the etiology of neonatal seizures.",

    "correct": "Myoclonic seizures",
    "explanation": "Myoclonic seizures in neonates are strongly associated with pyridoxine dependency, though other seizure types can also occur. Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy classically presents with refractory myoclonic or mixed seizures in the neonatal period that are resistant to conventional antiseizure medications but respond dramatically to pyridoxine administration. The condition is caused by mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene encoding antiquitin, resulting in accumulation of α-aminoadipic semialdehyde and inactivation of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, the active form of vitamin B6.",

    "correct": "Trial of pyridoxine",
    "explanation": "In a term neonate with drug-resistant seizures and normal neuroimaging, a therapeutic trial of pyridoxine should be performed to evaluate for pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy. This rare but treatable metabolic cause of neonatal seizures can be diagnosed by observing clinical and EEG response to intravenous pyridoxine administration. Untreated pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy leads to severe developmental consequences, making early diagnosis critical. The diagnostic evaluation should also include other vitamin-responsive epilepsies (e.g., pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, folinic acid, biotin), but pyridoxine trial is often the first step due to its safety, availability, and the devastating consequences of missed diagnosis.",

      "Surfactant deficiency",
      "Transient tachypnea",
      "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia"
    ],
    "correct": "Surfactant deficiency",
    "explanation": "RDS in premature infants is primarily caused by a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant, which is a complex mixture of phospholipids and proteins produced by type II alveolar cells. Surfactant reduces surface tension in the alveoli, preventing collapse at end-expiration. In premature infants, the lungs may not have developed adequate surfactant production capability, leading to atelectasis, increased work of breathing, and hypoxemia.",

    ],
    "correct": "Diffuse reticulogranular pattern with air bronchograms",
    "explanation": "The classic radiographic appearance of neonatal RDS is a diffuse reticulogranular (ground-glass) pattern throughout both lung fields with air bronchograms. This pattern reflects widespread microatelectasis with relative sparing of the air-filled bronchi, creating the air bronchogram effect. The lungs often appear underinflated with decreased lung volumes.",

      "34 weeks",
      "36 weeks",
      "38 weeks"
    ],
    "correct": "34 weeks",
    "explanation": "The risk of RDS significantly decreases after 34 weeks of gestation, which corresponds to the gestational age when sufficient surfactant production typically develops. Before this time, there is a higher risk of surfactant deficiency, with the risk being inversely proportional to gestational age. Nearly all infants born before 28 weeks gestation will develop RDS if not treated with antenatal steroids or postnatal surfactant.",

    ],
    "correct": "Maternal corticosteroids",
    "explanation": "Antenatal corticosteroids (betamethasone or dexamethasone) administered to women at risk of preterm delivery accelerate fetal lung maturity by stimulating surfactant production and structural maturation of the lungs. A complete course of antenatal corticosteroids (two doses 24 hours apart) given 24 hours to 7 days before delivery can reduce the risk of RDS by approximately 50%, as well as decrease the severity of RDS when it does occur.",

    "explanation": "Stridor, which is a high-pitched monophonic inspiratory sound caused by upper airway obstruction, is not typically associated with RDS. RDS is characterized by tachypnea, nasal flaring, grunting (an expiratory sound due to closure of the glottis to maintain positive end-expiratory pressure), and intercostal/subcostal retractions due to increased work of breathing from decreased lung compliance.",

    "correct": "Phosphatidylcholine",
    "explanation": "Phosphatidylcholine (PC), particularly dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), is the most abundant phospholipid component of pulmonary surfactant (approximately 70-80% of total phospholipids). DPPC is primarily responsible for the surface tension-lowering properties of surfactant at the air-liquid interface in the alveoli, preventing alveolar collapse during expiration.",

    "correct": "Surfactant protein A",
    "explanation": "Commercial exogenous surfactant preparations used to treat RDS typically contain phospholipids, neutral lipids, and the hydrophobic surfactant proteins B and C, but they lack surfactant protein A (SP-A). SP-A is a hydrophilic protein that plays a role in host defense and surfactant homeostasis but is not essential for the surface tension-lowering properties of surfactant. Current extraction methods and purification processes for animal-derived surfactants do not preserve SP-A, and synthetic surfactants do not include it.",

    ],
    "correct": "Persistent pulmonary hypertension",
    "explanation": "Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a complication that can occur in infants with RDS. The hypoxemia and acidosis from RDS can lead to pulmonary vasoconstriction, increasing pulmonary vascular resistance. This results in right-to-left shunting through the patent foramen ovale and/or patent ductus arteriosus, worsening the hypoxemia and creating a vicious cycle. PPHN can significantly complicate the management of RDS and lead to poorer outcomes.",

    "correct": "Lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio in amniotic fluid",
    "explanation": "The lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio in amniotic fluid is considered the gold standard test for fetal lung maturity. Lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) is a major component of surfactant, while sphingomyelin serves as a reference since its concentration remains relatively constant. An L/S ratio greater than 2:1 generally indicates pulmonary maturity and a low risk of RDS. Additional tests that may be used include presence of phosphatidylglycerol and lamellar body counts.",

    ],
    "correct": "21-30% oxygen",
    "explanation": "Current neonatal resuscitation guidelines recommend initiating resuscitation of premature infants with a lower oxygen concentration (21-30%) rather than 100% oxygen, with subsequent titration based on pre-ductal oxygen saturation targets. This approach aims to minimize oxidative stress and potential oxygen toxicity while ensuring adequate oxygenation. Studies have shown that high oxygen concentrations during resuscitation may be associated with increased mortality and morbidity, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity.",
