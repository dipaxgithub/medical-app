    ],
    "correct": "Night blindness (nyctalopia)",
    "explanation": "Night blindness (nyctalopia) is typically the earliest and most common ocular manifestation of vitamin A deficiency. It occurs due to impaired rhodopsin synthesis in the retina, affecting the rod photoreceptors responsible for vision in low light conditions. This symptom often precedes other ocular manifestations and can be reversed with vitamin A supplementation.",

    "explanation": "Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months is protective against vitamin A deficiency, not a risk factor. Human milk contains adequate vitamin A for infants up to 6 months of age when the mother is well-nourished. Other listed options are established risk factors: measles depletes vitamin A stores, malnutrition impairs absorption and storage, persistent diarrhea increases loss, and maternal deficiency leads to low vitamin A content in breast milk.",

    "explanation": "Keratomalacia, the most severe ocular manifestation of vitamin A deficiency, is characterized by corneal ulceration and colliquative necrosis (liquefactive necrosis) of the cornea. This occurs due to severe keratinization of the corneal epithelium, loss of corneal structural integrity, and subsequent bacterial invasion. Without urgent treatment, this condition can rapidly progress to corneal perforation, anterior staphyloma, and permanent blindness.",

    "correct": "Compromised epithelial barriers and decreased immune function",
    "explanation": "Vitamin A deficiency compromises the integrity of epithelial barriers throughout the body (respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary tract) and impairs immune function through multiple mechanisms. It reduces the production of secretory IgA, impairs T-cell mediated immunity, decreases natural killer cell activity, and affects cytokine production. The loss of epithelial barrier function combined with impaired immune response significantly increases susceptibility to infections, particularly respiratory and diarrheal diseases.",

    "explanation": "Bitot's spots are classic signs of vitamin A deficiency affecting the conjunctiva. They appear as foamy, triangular, grayish-white, slightly elevated lesions on the temporal conjunctiva, typically bilateral. These spots consist of keratinized epithelial debris and saprophytic bacteria (particularly Corynebacterium xerosis). Bitot's spots are pathognomonic for vitamin A deficiency when accompanied by conjunctival xerosis, though in severe chronic deficiency, they may persist even after vitamin A supplementation.",

    "explanation": "Vitamin A deficiency is most prevalent in preschool children aged 6-59 months globally. This age group is particularly vulnerable due to increased physiological requirements during rapid growth, potentially inadequate complementary feeding practices after exclusive breastfeeding ends, higher exposure to infections that deplete vitamin A stores, and limited dietary diversity in many resource-limited settings. WHO estimates that approximately 190 million preschool children worldwide are affected by vitamin A deficiency.",

    ],
    "correct": "Squamous metaplasia replacing ciliated epithelium",
    "explanation": "Vitamin A deficiency causes squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium, where normal ciliated columnar epithelium is replaced by stratified squamous epithelium. This metaplastic change impairs mucociliary clearance, reducing the respiratory tract's ability to remove pathogens and particulates. The loss of ciliated cells and goblet cells (which produce protective mucus) compromises the mechanical barrier function of the respiratory tract, contributing to increased susceptibility to respiratory infections in vitamin A deficient children.",

    "explanation": "The relative dose response (RDR) test is considered the gold standard for assessing vitamin A status in children. It measures the percentage change in serum retinol concentration before and after administration of a small dose of vitamin A. The test reflects liver vitamin A reserves more accurately than static measures like serum retinol. An RDR value >20% indicates depleted liver stores. While more precise than serum retinol measurement, the RDR test requires two blood samples and is more complex to perform, making it less practical for large-scale assessments.",

While other laboratory findings such as anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, increased ESR, and elevated alkaline phosphatase may be present, they are not specific for scurvy.

Human breast milk contains insufficient amounts of vitamin D to prevent rickets (approximately 25 IU/L), and darker skin pigmentation reduces vitamin D synthesis in the skin upon sun exposure.

    ],
    "correct": "Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D",
    "explanation": "Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is considered the gold standard laboratory test for assessing vitamin D status as it reflects both dietary intake and cutaneous production of vitamin D. It has a relatively long half-life (2-3 weeks) and is the major circulating form of vitamin D. In contrast, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (the active metabolite) has a short half-life (4-6 hours), is tightly regulated, and may be normal or even elevated in vitamin D deficiency due to secondary hyperparathyroidism.",

      "Calcium deficiency",
      "Vitamin D deficiency",
      "Combined calcium and vitamin D deficiency",
      "Phosphorus deficiency",
      "Genetic disorders of vitamin D metabolism"
    ],
    "correct": "Combined calcium and vitamin D deficiency",
    "explanation": "The most common cause of rickets worldwide is combined calcium and vitamin D deficiency. In many developing countries, especially in Africa and parts of Asia, dietary calcium deficiency often coexists with vitamin D deficiency. Inadequate calcium intake, even with adequate vitamin D levels, can lead to nutritional rickets. Studies have shown that in such populations, treatment outcomes are best when both calcium and vitamin D are supplemented.",

    "question": "A 2-year-old child presents with bowed legs, widened wrists, and delayed walking. Laboratory results show normal calcium, low phosphorus, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "Nutritional rickets",
      "Hypophosphatemic rickets",
      "Renal osteodystrophy",
      "Vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1",
      "Metaphyseal chondrodysplasia"
    ],
    "correct": "Hypophosphatemic rickets",
    "explanation": "The clinical presentation with bowed legs, widened wrists, and delayed walking suggests rickets. The laboratory findings of normal calcium, low phosphorus, elevated alkaline phosphatase, but normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are characteristic of hypophosphatemic rickets, commonly due to X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH). In nutritional rickets, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels would be low. Vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1 would show low or normal phosphorus but with hypocalcemia. Renal osteodystrophy typically shows more complex electrolyte abnormalities including hyperphosphatemia. Metaphyseal chondrodysplasia is a skeletal dysplasia without the characteristic biochemical abnormalities.",
