    ],
    "correct": "Night blindness (nyctalopia)",
    "explanation": "Night blindness (nyctalopia) is typically the earliest and most common ocular manifestation of vitamin A deficiency. It occurs due to impaired rhodopsin synthesis in the retina, affecting the rod photoreceptors responsible for vision in low light conditions. This symptom often precedes other ocular manifestations and can be reversed with vitamin A supplementation.",

    "explanation": "Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months is protective against vitamin A deficiency, not a risk factor. Human milk contains adequate vitamin A for infants up to 6 months of age when the mother is well-nourished. Other listed options are established risk factors: measles depletes vitamin A stores, malnutrition impairs absorption and storage, persistent diarrhea increases loss, and maternal deficiency leads to low vitamin A content in breast milk.",

    "explanation": "Keratomalacia, the most severe ocular manifestation of vitamin A deficiency, is characterized by corneal ulceration and colliquative necrosis (liquefactive necrosis) of the cornea. This occurs due to severe keratinization of the corneal epithelium, loss of corneal structural integrity, and subsequent bacterial invasion. Without urgent treatment, this condition can rapidly progress to corneal perforation, anterior staphyloma, and permanent blindness.",

    "correct": "Compromised epithelial barriers and decreased immune function",
    "explanation": "Vitamin A deficiency compromises the integrity of epithelial barriers throughout the body (respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary tract) and impairs immune function through multiple mechanisms. It reduces the production of secretory IgA, impairs T-cell mediated immunity, decreases natural killer cell activity, and affects cytokine production. The loss of epithelial barrier function combined with impaired immune response significantly increases susceptibility to infections, particularly respiratory and diarrheal diseases.",

They appear as foamy, triangular, grayish-white, slightly elevated lesions on the temporal conjunctiva, typically bilateral. These spots consist of keratinized epithelial debris and saprophytic bacteria (particularly Corynebacterium xerosis). Bitot's spots are pathognomonic for vitamin A deficiency when accompanied by conjunctival xerosis, though in severe chronic deficiency, they may persist even after vitamin A supplementation.",

    "explanation": "Vitamin A deficiency is most prevalent in preschool children aged 6-59 months globally. This age group is particularly vulnerable due to increased physiological requirements during rapid growth, potentially inadequate complementary feeding practices after exclusive breastfeeding ends, higher exposure to infections that deplete vitamin A stores, and limited dietary diversity in many resource-limited settings. WHO estimates that approximately 190 million preschool children worldwide are affected by vitamin A deficiency.",

    ],
    "correct": "Squamous metaplasia replacing ciliated epithelium",
    "explanation": "Vitamin A deficiency causes squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium, where normal ciliated columnar epithelium is replaced by stratified squamous epithelium. This metaplastic change impairs mucociliary clearance, reducing the respiratory tract's ability to remove pathogens and particulates. The loss of ciliated cells and goblet cells (which produce protective mucus) compromises the mechanical barrier function of the respiratory tract, contributing to increased susceptibility to respiratory infections in vitamin A deficient children.",

    "explanation": "The relative dose response (RDR) test is considered the gold standard for assessing vitamin A status in children. It measures the percentage change in serum retinol concentration before and after administration of a small dose of vitamin A. The test reflects liver vitamin A reserves more accurately than static measures like serum retinol. An RDR value >20% indicates depleted liver stores. While more precise than serum retinol measurement, the RDR test requires two blood samples and is more complex to perform, making it less practical for large-scale assessments.",

While other laboratory findings such as anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, increased ESR, and elevated alkaline phosphatase may be present, they are not specific for scurvy.

   "correct": "Facilitation of calcium and phosphate absorption for bone mineralization",
   "explanation": "The primary mechanism by which vitamin D promotes bone health is through facilitating intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate, which are essential minerals for proper bone mineralization. By maintaining adequate serum calcium and phosphate levels, vitamin D ensures the mineralization of newly formed osteoid tissue, preventing rickets in growing children and osteomalacia in adults.",

   "question": "Which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment for a 2-year-old child with nutritional rickets?",
   "options": [
      "Calcitriol 0.25 mcg daily",
      "Vitamin D2 50,000 IU weekly for 6 weeks",
      "Calcium supplementation only",
      "Phosphate supplements",
      "Surgical correction of bone deformities"
   ],
   "correct": "Vitamin D2 50,000 IU weekly for 6 weeks",
   "explanation": "The initial treatment for nutritional rickets typically involves high-dose vitamin D (either D2 or D3) to rapidly correct the deficiency, such as 50,000 IU weekly for 6 weeks. This is often accompanied by calcium supplementation to ensure adequate substrate for bone mineralization. This approach rapidly corrects biochemical abnormalities and leads to radiographic healing within 2-3 months. Calcitriol is typically reserved for patients with impaired renal hydroxylation.",
