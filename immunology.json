      "Absolute neutrophil count < 1500/μL",
      "Absolute neutrophil count < 500/μL",
      "Absolute neutrophil count < 2000/μL",
      "Absolute neutrophil count < 100/μL"
    ],
    "correct": "Absolute neutrophil count < 1500/μL",
    "explanation": "The most widely accepted definition of neutropenia in children is an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1500/μL. However, it's important to note that normal neutrophil counts vary by age and ethnicity. For example, individuals of African or Middle Eastern descent may have lower baseline neutrophil counts.",

    "question": "Which of the following is the most common cause of neutropenia in children?",
    "options": [
      "Kostmann syndrome",
      "Drug-induced neutropenia",
      "Viral infections",
      "Cyclic neutropenia",
      "Autoimmune neutropenia"
    ],
    "correct": "Viral infections",
    "explanation": "Viral infections are the most common cause of neutropenia in the pediatric population. Common viral pathogens include influenza, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and parvovirus B19. These infections typically cause a transient decrease in neutrophil count that resolves as the infection clears.",

    "question": "Which of the following is the most common cause of chronic benign neutropenia in young children?",

      "Cyclic neutropenia",
      "Kostmann syndrome",
      "Autoimmune neutropenia of infancy",
      "Shwachman-Diamond syndrome",
      "Drug-induced neutropenia"
    ],
    "correct": "Autoimmune neutropenia of infancy",
    "explanation": "Autoimmune neutropenia of infancy is the most common cause of chronic neutropenia in children under 5 years of age. It is characterized by the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies, typically has a benign course with few serious infections, and often spontaneously resolves within 6-24 months.",

  {
    "question": "What is the typical pattern of neutrophil counts in cyclic neutropenia?",
    "options": [
      "Consistently low neutrophil counts",
      "Regular oscillations with 21-day periodicity",
      "Gradual decline over months",
      "Random fluctuations between normal and low",
      "Low counts only during infections"
    ],
    "correct": "Regular oscillations with 21-day periodicity",
    "explanation": "Cyclic neutropenia is characterized by regular oscillations in neutrophil counts that typically occur every 21 days (range 14-35 days). During nadirs, the ANC often drops below 200/μL for 3-5 days, followed by recovery to normal levels. Diagnosis requires serial CBCs (2-3 times weekly for 6 weeks) to document this pattern.",

      "WAS gene",
      "GATA2 gene"
    ],
    "correct": "ELANE gene",
    "explanation": "Mutations in the ELANE gene (formerly known as ELA2), which encodes neutrophil elastase, are the most common genetic cause of severe congenital neutropenia, accounting for approximately 50-60% of cases. These mutations lead to misfolded neutrophil elastase which triggers the unfolded protein response and causes apoptosis of neutrophil precursors.",

    "question": "What is the primary risk factor for serious bacterial infections in children with neutropenia?",

      "Presence of fever",
      "Underlying cause of neutropenia",
      "Patient age"
    ],
    "correct": "Absolute neutrophil count",
    "explanation": "The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is the primary determinant of infection risk in neutropenic patients. The risk of serious bacterial infection increases significantly when the ANC falls below 500/μL, with the highest risk occurring at counts below 200/μL. Duration of neutropenia is also important, but ANC level is the most critical factor.",

      "Skeletal abnormalities",
      "Cognitive impairment",
      "Increased risk of myelodysplastic syndrome"
    ],
    "correct": "Cognitive impairment",
    "explanation": "Shwachman-Diamond syndrome is characterized by neutropenia, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, skeletal abnormalities (metaphyseal dysostosis), and an increased risk of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. Cognitive impairment is not a typical feature of this disorder, which distinguishes it from some other inherited bone marrow failure syndromes.",

      "Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)",
      "Prophylactic antibiotics"
    ],
    "correct": "Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)",
    "explanation": "Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, filgrastim) is the first-line treatment for severe chronic neutropenia, including congenital, cyclic, and idiopathic forms. G-CSF stimulates neutrophil production and maturation, effectively increasing the neutrophil count in most patients. Over 90% of patients with severe congenital neutropenia respond to G-CSF with increased neutrophil counts and reduced infection frequency.",

      "Wilms tumor",
      "Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia",
      "Neuroblastoma"
    ],
    "correct": "Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia",
    "explanation": "Patients with severe congenital neutropenia have an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The cumulative incidence of MDS/AML in these patients is approximately 15-25% after 15 years. This risk appears to be related to the underlying genetic defect rather than G-CSF therapy, although higher doses of G-CSF may be associated with increased risk.",

    "question": "Which of the following findings would be most concerning for a diagnosis of leukemia in a child with neutropenia?",
    "options": [
      "History of recurrent viral infections",

      "Concurrent thrombocytopenia and anemia",
      "Mild splenomegaly",
      "Periodic oscillations in neutrophil count"
    ],
    "correct": "Concurrent thrombocytopenia and anemia",
    "explanation": "The presence of neutropenia along with abnormalities in other cell lines (thrombocytopenia and anemia) is concerning for bone marrow infiltration or failure, with leukemia being a primary consideration. This pattern, often called pancytopenia, suggests a process affecting all hematopoietic lineages and warrants immediate evaluation with peripheral blood smear and bone marrow examination.",
