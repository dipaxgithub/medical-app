      "Absolute neutrophil count < 100/μL"
    ],
    "correct": "Absolute neutrophil count < 1500/μL",
    "explanation": "The most widely accepted definition of neutropenia in children is an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1500/μL. However, it's important to note that normal neutrophil counts vary by age and ethnicity. For example, individuals of African or Middle Eastern descent may have lower baseline neutrophil counts.",

    "correct": "Viral infections",
    "explanation": "Viral infections are the most common cause of neutropenia in the pediatric population. Common viral pathogens include influenza, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and parvovirus B19. These infections typically cause a transient decrease in neutrophil count that resolves as the infection clears.",

    "explanation": "Autoimmune neutropenia of infancy is the most common cause of chronic neutropenia in children under 5 years of age.

    "correct": "Regular oscillations with 21-day periodicity",
    "explanation": "Cyclic neutropenia is characterized by regular oscillations in neutrophil counts that typically occur every 21 days (range 14-35 days). During nadirs, the ANC often drops below 200/μL for 3-5 days, followed by recovery to normal levels. Diagnosis requires serial CBCs (2-3 times weekly for 6 weeks) to document this pattern.",

    "explanation": "Mutations in the ELANE gene (formerly known as ELA2), which encodes neutrophil elastase, are the most common genetic cause of severe congenital neutropenia, accounting for approximately 50-60% of cases. These mutations lead to misfolded neutrophil elastase which triggers the unfolded protein response and causes apoptosis of neutrophil precursors.",

    ],
    "correct": "Absolute neutrophil count",
    "explanation": "The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is the primary determinant of infection risk in neutropenic patients. The risk of serious bacterial infection increases significantly when the ANC falls below 500/μL, with the highest risk occurring at counts below 200/μL. Duration of neutropenia is also important, but ANC level is the most critical factor.",

    "explanation": "Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, filgrastim) is the first-line treatment for severe chronic neutropenia, including congenital, cyclic, and idiopathic forms.

The cumulative incidence of MDS/AML in these patients is approximately 15-25% after 15 years. This risk appears to be related to the underlying genetic defect rather than G-CSF therapy, although higher doses of G-CSF may be associated with increased risk.",
