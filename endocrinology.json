      "Thyroid dyshormogenesis",
      "Maternal antibodies"
    ],
    "correct": "Thyroid dysgenesis",
    "explanation": "Thyroid dysgenesis (abnormal thyroid gland development) accounts for approximately 80-85% of permanent congenital hypothyroidism cases in iodine-sufficient regions. This includes thyroid agenesis (complete absence), hypoplasia (underdevelopment), and ectopic thyroid tissue (most commonly sublingual).",

    "question": "Which screening test is most commonly used for congenital hypothyroidism in newborn screening programs?",
    "options": [
      "Free T4 alone",
      "Total T4 alone",
      "TSH alone",
      "TSH and Free T4",
      "Total T3"
    ],
    "correct": "TSH alone",
    "explanation": "Most newborn screening programs worldwide use TSH as the primary screening test for congenital hypothyroidism. TSH elevation is the most sensitive indicator of primary hypothyroidism, which represents the vast majority of congenital hypothyroidism cases. Some programs use a combined TSH and T4 approach or a two-tier system, but TSH alone is the most common initial screening method.",

    "question": "What is the optimal age for initiating treatment in a newborn diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism?",
    "options": [
      "Within the first 24 hours of life",
      "Within the first 7 days of life",
      "Within the first 14 days of life",
      "Within the first 21 days of life",
      "Within the first month of life"
    ],
    "correct": "Within the first 14 days of life",
    "explanation": "Treatment for congenital hypothyroidism should ideally be initiated within the first 14 days of life to prevent neurodevelopmental deficits. Studies have shown that infants who begin treatment before 14 days of age have better intellectual outcomes compared to those who start treatment later. Earlier treatment (within the first 7 days) may be even more beneficial, but the 14-day mark is considered the critical threshold.",

    "question": "What is the recommended initial dose of levothyroxine for a term newborn with congenital hypothyroidism?",
    "options": [
      "5-7 μg/kg/day",

    "correct": "10-15 μg/kg/day",
    "explanation": "The recommended initial dose of levothyroxine for a term newborn with congenital hypothyroidism is 10-15 μg/kg/day. This higher dose is necessary to rapidly normalize thyroid hormone levels and optimize neurodevelopmental outcomes. Lower doses may lead to persistent hypothyroidism, while higher doses may cause adverse effects including craniosynostosis and hyperactivity.",

    "question": "Which of the following findings is NOT typically associated with congenital hypothyroidism in the newborn period?",

      "Macroglossia",
      "Hyperthermia",
      "Constipation"
    ],
    "correct": "Hyperthermia",
    "explanation": "Hyperthermia is not associated with congenital hypothyroidism. In fact, hypothermia is a classic finding due to decreased metabolic rate and heat production. Other typical findings include prolonged jaundice, large anterior fontanelle, macroglossia, constipation, hypotonia, lethargy, feeding difficulties, and coarse facial features. However, due to early detection through newborn screening, many infants are now diagnosed and treated before these clinical signs become apparent.",

    "question": "Which radiographic finding is characteristic of advanced, untreated congenital hypothyroidism?",

      "Delayed appearance of ossification centers",
      "Increased bone density",
      "Early eruption of primary teeth"
    ],
    "correct": "Delayed appearance of ossification centers",
    "explanation": "Delayed appearance of ossification centers is characteristic of advanced, untreated congenital hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone is essential for normal bone maturation, and its deficiency leads to delayed skeletal maturation. This can be observed radiographically as delayed appearance of ossification centers, particularly in the knee and foot. Other skeletal findings may include stippled epiphyses and retarded linear growth.",

    "question": "Which maternal condition is most strongly associated with transient congenital hypothyroidism in the newborn?",

      "Maternal iodine deficiency",
      "Maternal use of propylthiouracil",
      "Maternal diabetes mellitus"
    ],
    "correct": "Maternal iodine deficiency",
    "explanation": "Maternal iodine deficiency is most strongly associated with transient congenital hypothyroidism in the newborn. Iodine is essential for thyroid hormone synthesis, and severe maternal deficiency can lead to fetal and neonatal hypothyroidism. Other causes of transient congenital hypothyroidism include maternal thyrotropin receptor blocking antibodies (TRBAbs), maternal use of antithyroid medications, and exposure to excess iodine (e.g., from antiseptic solutions).",

    "question": "Which genetic mutation is most commonly associated with thyroid dyshormonogenesis?",

      "FOXE1 (forkhead box E1)",
      "PAX8 (paired box 8)"
    ],
    "correct": "TPO (thyroid peroxidase)",
    "explanation": "Mutations in the TPO (thyroid peroxidase) gene are the most common cause of thyroid dyshormonogenesis, accounting for approximately 50% of cases. TPO is essential for iodine organification and thyroid hormone synthesis. Mutations in this gene result in impaired thyroid hormone production despite the presence of a normally located and sized thyroid gland. Other genes associated with dyshormonogenesis include TG (thyroglobulin), DUOX2, DUOXA2, IYD, SLC5A5 (NIS), and SLC26A4 (pendrin).",

      "1 week",
      "2 weeks",
      "4 weeks",
      "3 months"
    ],
    "correct": "2 weeks",
    "explanation": "The first follow-up laboratory assessment should be performed approximately 2 weeks after initiating treatment for congenital hypothyroidism. This timing allows evaluation of the initial response to therapy and provides an opportunity for dose adjustment if needed. The goal is to normalize free T4 levels as quickly as possible, ideally within 2 weeks of starting treatment, while avoiding overtreatment. TSH normalization typically lags behind free T4 normalization.",

    "question": "Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with congenital hypothyroidism?",
    "options": [
      "Most children with congenital hypothyroidism have severe intellectual disability despite early treatment",
      "Neurodevelopmental outcomes are primarily determined by the etiology of congenital hypothyroidism",
      "Children with congenital hypothyroidism typically have normal intelligence but specific deficits in motor skills",
      "Early treatment with adequate doses of levothyroxine leads to normal intellectual outcomes in most cases",
      "Neurodevelopmental outcomes are unrelated to the timing of treatment initiation"
    ],
    "correct": "Early treatment with adequate doses of levothyroxine leads to normal intellectual outcomes in most cases",
    "explanation": "Early treatment with adequate doses of levothyroxine leads to normal intellectual outcomes in most cases of congenital hypothyroidism. The introduction of newborn screening programs has dramatically improved outcomes, with most treated children achieving normal intelligence. However, subtle neurocognitive deficits may persist in some children, particularly those with severe hypothyroidism at diagnosis (very low T4, very high TSH), delayed treatment initiation, or poor treatment compliance. The severity of hypothyroidism at diagnosis and the timing of treatment initiation are the most important determinants of neurodevelopmental outcomes.",
