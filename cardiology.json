    ],
    "correct": "Within 24-48 hours of birth",
    "explanation": "In term neonates, functional closure of the ductus arteriosus typically occurs within 24-48 hours after birth, primarily due to increased arterial oxygen tension and decreased circulating prostaglandins. Anatomical closure follows over the next 2-3 weeks. Delayed closure or persistent patency constitutes a PDA.",

    "explanation": "Indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, is considered a first-line pharmacological agent for PDA closure in premature infants.

    "explanation": "A large PDA in a 6-month-old typically presents with failure to thrive, poor feeding, increased work of breathing, and recurrent respiratory infections due to pulmonary overcirculation. The increased pulmonary blood flow and left heart volume overload lead to symptoms of congestive heart failure, which impact growth and increase susceptibility to respiratory infections.",

    "explanation": "A moderate-sized PDA classically produces a continuous 'machinery' murmur that persists throughout systole and diastole, heard best in the left infraclavicular area or upper left sternal border. This characteristic sound results from the continuous flow of blood from the aorta to the pulmonary artery throughout the cardiac cycle due to the persistent pressure gradient.",

    "explanation": "The incidence of PDA is inversely related to gestational age, with extremely premature infants (<28 weeks) having the highest rates, approaching 70-80%. This is due to developmental immaturity of the ductal tissue and decreased responsiveness to oxygen-induced constriction, combined with increased sensitivity to circulating prostaglandins that maintain ductal patency.",

Other parameters include ductal diameter, direction and pattern of ductal flow, and presence of diastolic flow reversal in the descending aorta.",

    "explanation": "The Amplatzer Duct Occluder (ADO) device is generally preferred for transcatheter PDA closure in infants >6 kg with suitable anatomy due to its high success rate, low incidence of residual shunting, and ease of deployment. The device consists of a nitinol mesh with a larger aortic retention disk and a smaller pulmonary end, specifically designed to conform to the conical shape of most PDAs.

    "correct": "Incidental finding of moderate PDA without symptoms",
    "explanation": "An incidental finding of a moderate PDA without symptoms (asymptomatic PDA) would not be an indication for intervention in a premature infant. Current evidence supports a more conservative, symptom-based approach to PDA management. Intervention is indicated when there are clinical sequelae attributable to the PDA, such as ventilator dependence, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hemorrhage, or compromised end-organ perfusion. Asymptomatic PDAs often close spontaneously and unnecessary treatment carries risks of interventional complications.",
