    "correct": "Streptococcus pneumoniae",
    "explanation": "Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common bacterial cause of community-acquired pneumonia in children 3 months to 5 years of age, despite the introduction of pneumococcal vaccines. Viral causes collectively may be more common, but as a single pathogen, S. pneumoniae is still predominant in this age group.",

    "correct": "Interstitial infiltrates",
    "explanation": "Atypical pneumonia, commonly caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae in school-aged children, typically presents with interstitial infiltrates on chest radiography. These diffuse, bilateral, reticular or reticulonodular patterns are distinct from the focal lobar consolidation commonly seen in typical bacterial pneumonia.",

    "correct": "Amoxicillin",
    "explanation": "Amoxicillin is recommended as first-line therapy for previously healthy, fully immunized children with presumed bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. It provides excellent coverage against Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common bacterial pathogen, and is preferred over broader-spectrum antibiotics to help reduce antimicrobial resistance.",

    "correct": "Nasal cannula at 2 L/min",
    "explanation": "For a child with pneumonia and moderate hypoxemia (SpO2 88%), supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 2 L/min is the most appropriate initial therapy. This provides sufficient oxygen to maintain saturation ≥92% while being well-tolerated by most children. Escalation to high-flow nasal cannula or non-invasive ventilation should be considered if the child fails to improve or shows signs of increased work of breathing.",

    "explanation": "Staphylococcus aureus, particularly strains producing Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) toxin, is most commonly associated with necrotizing pneumonia in children. This severe form of pneumonia is characterized by rapid progression, tissue necrosis, cavitation, and often pneumatocele formation. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) frequently harbors the PVL genes, contributing to its virulence.",

      "Initial diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia",
      "Recurrent pneumonia in the same anatomical location"
    ],
    "correct": "Recurrent pneumonia in the same anatomical location",
    "explanation": "Recurrent pneumonia in the same anatomical location is an appropriate indication for chest CT as it suggests an underlying anatomical abnormality such as congenital pulmonary airway malformation, bronchial stenosis, or foreign body aspiration that may not be visible on plain radiographs. CT imaging helps identify these structural abnormalities that predispose to recurrent infections in the same location.",

    "explanation": "Hypoxemia (SpO2 <90%) that persists despite supplemental oxygen is the strongest predictor of severe pneumonia requiring ICU admission in children. It indicates significant ventilation-perfusion mismatch, extensive disease, or impending respiratory failure. Other concerning signs include altered mental status, respiratory rate >70 breaths/min in infants, and signs of sepsis or shock.",

    "correct": "Cystic fibrosis",
    "explanation": "Cystic fibrosis remains the most common cause of bronchiectasis in children in developed countries, accounting for approximately 30-50% of cases. The CFTR gene mutation leads to abnormal mucus production and clearance, predisposing to recurrent respiratory infections and subsequent bronchiectasis.",

    "correct": "High-resolution CT scan (HRCT)",
    "explanation": "HRCT is the gold standard for diagnosing bronchiectasis in children. It can detect bronchiectasis with high sensitivity and specificity by revealing bronchial dilatation, bronchial wall thickening, lack of bronchial tapering, and air trapping. Chest X-rays have limited sensitivity and may miss early or mild bronchiectasis.",

    "correct": "Daily wet/productive cough for > 4 weeks",
    "explanation": "A chronic wet/productive cough persisting for more than 4 weeks is the most common and characteristic clinical feature of bronchiectasis in children. The presence of a persistent wet cough should prompt further investigation for bronchiectasis, especially if accompanied by recurrent respiratory infections, growth failure, or digital clubbing.",

    ],
    "correct": "Mixed obstructive and restrictive pattern",
    "explanation": "Children with bronchiectasis typically demonstrate a mixed obstructive and restrictive pattern on pulmonary function tests. The obstructive component results from airway inflammation, mucus plugging, and airway remodeling, while the restrictive component may develop from fibrosis and volume loss in affected lung segments. Pulmonary function tests may be normal in early or mild disease.",

    "explanation": "Haemophilus influenzae (often non-typeable strains) is the most frequently isolated pathogen from respiratory samples in children with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, found in approximately 30-70% of cases. Other common pathogens include Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is more common in advanced disease or in cystic fibrosis-related bronchiectasis.",

    "explanation": "Airway clearance techniques have demonstrated the strongest evidence for improving quality of life and reducing exacerbations in children with bronchiectasis. These techniques, including chest physiotherapy, active cycle of breathing, positive expiratory pressure devices, and exercise, help mobilize secretions and enhance mucociliary clearance. They form the cornerstone of bronchiectasis management and should be individualized based on the child's age, capability, and preference.",

    "correct": "Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)",
    "explanation": "Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the immunodeficiency most commonly associated with bronchiectasis in children. CVID is characterized by impaired B-cell differentiation leading to hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent sinopulmonary infections. Approximately 30-60% of patients with CVID develop bronchiectasis, often in the middle and lower lobes. Early diagnosis and immunoglobulin replacement therapy can reduce the risk of bronchiectasis development.",

      "Right lower lobe",
      "Left upper lobe",

    "correct": "Left lower lobe",
    "explanation": "The left lower lobe is most commonly affected in children with post-infectious bronchiectasis, followed by the right middle lobe and lingula. This distribution pattern differs from cystic fibrosis-related bronchiectasis, which typically shows upper lobe predominance in advanced disease. The predilection for lower lobes in post-infectious bronchiectasis may be related to gravity-dependent clearance mechanisms and regional differences in ventilation.",

      "Ciliary biopsy and electron microscopy",
      "Serological testing for allergies"
    ],
    "correct": "Sweat chloride test",
    "explanation": "The sweat chloride test is the most important initial investigation in a child with newly diagnosed bronchiectasis, as cystic fibrosis remains the most common identifiable cause of bronchiectasis in children in developed countries. Even in the absence of typical gastrointestinal symptoms, CF should be ruled out before proceeding with more invasive or specialized investigations. Additional testing should include immune function assessment, spirometry, and consideration of primary ciliary dyskinesia evaluation based on clinical context.",

    "explanation": "The 'signet ring sign' on HRCT, where the bronchial diameter is greater than the adjacent pulmonary artery (bronchial-arterial ratio >1), is the most specific radiological finding for bronchiectasis in children. Other supportive findings include lack of bronchial tapering toward the periphery, bronchial wall thickening, and visualization of bronchi in the peripheral third of the lung field. While air trapping, peribronchial thickening, and mosaic attenuation may be present in bronchiectasis, they are less specific and can occur in other respiratory conditions.",
